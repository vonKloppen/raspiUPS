# raspiUPS
Waveshare UPS HAT (C) control daemon for Raspberry Pi Zero

It can log power changes (main/battery) to syslog and logs power/voltage/current to file.

Also it will power off Raspberry if battery treshold is reached.

Setup part is stolen from Waveshare example code: https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/4/40/UPS_HAT_C.7z
